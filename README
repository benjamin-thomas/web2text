Convert reddit HTML content to text

I use this in conjunction with a text-to-speach engine.

curl 'https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3cl12r/is_rust_too_complicated/' | reddit2text
cat /tmp/saved.html | reddit2text
reddit2text /tmp/saved.html

Reddit and hackernews have a pocket export link, so those couple of script aren't that usefull anymore
